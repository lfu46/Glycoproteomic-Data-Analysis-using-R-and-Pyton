## Two Examples Demonstrating the Use of Package Functions in Proteomic Data Analysis
### 1. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two distributions and assess whether they differ significantly. It measures the maximum absolute difference between their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).

In proteomics, the K-S test is often used to compare the physicochemical properties of two groups of proteins (e.g., the isoelectric points of upregulated vs. downregulated proteins) or to compare fold changes across different protein categories (e.g., RNA-binding vs. non RNA-binding proteins). However, challenges arise when the data is not tidy or when comparing the distributions of multiple protein groups.

For instance, in an experiment involving newly synthesized proteins, we may want to investigate the effect of inhibitors (such as Btz and 3MA) on the abundance of newly synthesized proteins across different sub-cellular compartments.

You can get access **training data 1** for this example using the following link: [training data 1](https://github.com/lfu46/Glycoproteomic-Data-Analysis-using-R-and-Python/blob/main/Chapter_1_R_Basics/training_data/training_data.csv)

Here is how you would read in the data and take a quick look at it:

```{r training data, echo = TRUE}
# import packages
packages_names <- c('tidyverse', 'readxl', 'writexl')
lapply(packages_names, require, character.only = TRUE)

# load training data 1
training_data <- read_csv(
  'training_data/training_data.csv'
)

# have a quick look at the data
head(training_data, n = 10)
```

The dataset contains 33 columns, including `Gene Name`, `Fold Change` and `GO Terms`, but the structure is inconsistent and unsuitable for further analysis. To prepare the data for statistical tests, we need to reshape it into a [tidy format](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-tidy-data), where each variable is stored in its own column and each observation is a row. This allows us to apply various data manipulation and statistical functions effectively.

In this case, we'll reshape the data and clean up the column names (especially removing slashes in `Btz/DMSO`, `3MA/DMSO` and `Comb/DMSO`).

```{r adjusted training data, echo = TRUE}
training_data_adj <- training_data |> 
  select(Gene, `Btz/DMSO`:`vacuole [GO:0005773]`) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = `plasma membrane [GO:0005886]`:`vacuole [GO:0005773]`, names_to = 'GO_Term', values_to = 'value') |>
  filter(value == 1) |> 
  select(Gene, Btz_DMSO = `Btz/DMSO`, `3MA_DMSO` = `3MA/DMSO`, Comb_DMSO = `Comb/DMSO`, GO_Term) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = Btz_DMSO:Comb_DMSO, names_to = 'Exp', values_to = 'Fold_Change')

# let us look at the adjusted data
head(training_data_adj, n = 10)
```

The adjusted data looks much better in a tidy way. Now we can define a function to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for each sub-cellular compartment (i.e., for each GO term). The function will compare the fold changes across the three conditions (`Btz_DMSO`, `3MA_DMSO`, and `Comb_DMSO`).

```{r function definition, echo = TRUE}
ks_test_function <- function(df){
  # get all possible combination of experimental conditions
  Exp_list <- unique(df$Exp)
  combs <- data.frame(combn(Exp_list, 2, simplify = TRUE))
  
  # generate result tibble
  tibble(
    GO_term_list = unique(df$GO_Term),
    comparison = map(combs, \(x) paste(x, collapse = " vs ")),
    p_value = map(combs, \(x) ks.test(
      df |> filter(Exp == x[1]) |> pull(Fold_Change),
      df |> filter(Exp == x[2]) |> pull(Fold_Change)
        )$p.value
      )
    )
}
```

Then we can apply the function to our data.

```{r ks.test}
comparison_p_value_df <- training_data_adj |> 
  group_by(GO_Term) |> 
  group_split() |> 
  # map_df applies the ks_test_function to each data frame in the list generated by group_split()
  map_df(ks_test_function) |> 
  unnest_longer(c(comparison, p_value))

# let us check the result
head(comparison_p_value_df, n = 20)
```

The results are well-organized and logical, with one column for `GO terms`, one for `comparisons`, and another for `p-values` from the KS test. We can visualize these results in a heatmap to better interpret the statistical differences between conditions across the various GO terms.

```{r training data heatmap}
# import ComplexHeatmap
library(ComplexHeatmap)

# change the format of our data
heatmap_comparison_p_value <- comparison_p_value_df |> 
  mutate(log_p_value = -log10(p_value)) |> 
  select(GO_term_list, comparison, log_p_value) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = comparison, values_from = log_p_value)

# check
head(heatmap_comparison_p_value, n = 10)

# generate data matrix
heatmap_matrix <- data.matrix(heatmap_comparison_p_value |> select(!GO_term_list))
rownames(heatmap_matrix) <- heatmap_comparison_p_value$GO_term_list

# check
heatmap_matrix

# plot the heatmap
Heatmap(heatmap_matrix, name = '-log10_p_value', color = heatmap_color)

```

The figure may not look optimal because we haven't fine-tuned the parameters. You can find all available parameters in the [ComplexHeatmap Complete Reference](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/). However, our focus now is on: What insights can we gain from this heatmap?

### 2. Violin boxplot
Next, we will use the data from `cytosol [GO:0005829]` to create a violin plot with boxplot overlays. 

```{r violin boxplot, echo = TRUE}
#import packages
packages_names <- c('showtext', 'rstatix', 'ggpubr')
lapply(packages_names, require, character.only = TRUE)

# statistical test
cytosol_wilcox_test <- training_data_adj |> 
  filter(GO_Term == 'cytosol [GO:0005829]') |> 
  # The Wilcoxon test is performed to compare the Fold Change between different
  # experimental conditions (Exp) with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
  wilcox_test(Fold_Change ~ Exp, p.adjust.method = 'BH')

# check
cytosol_wilcox_test

# violin boxplot
# The showtext package is used to load and use the Arial font (or any custom font). This ensures the font is displayed correctly in the plot.
font_add(family = 'arial', regular = 'arial.ttf')
# showtext_auto() enables the automatic use of this font in the plot rendering.
showtext_auto()

violin_boxplot_cytosol <- training_data_adj |> 
  filter(GO_Term == 'cytosol [GO:0005829]') |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_violin(
    aes(x = Exp, y = Fold_Change), fill = '#4b1978', color = 'transparent'
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(x = Exp, y = Fold_Change), width = 0.2, outliers = FALSE
  ) +
  # stat_pvalue_manual() overlays the p-value results from the Wilcoxon test on the plot, indicating
  # statistical significance between the experimental conditions.
  stat_pvalue_manual(
    data = cytosol_wilcox_test, label = 'p.adj.signif', hide.ns = TRUE,
    tip.length = 0, y.position = c(1.8), label.size = 6
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'Fold Change') +
  # theme_bw() applies a clean black-and-white theme to the plot.
  theme_bw() +
  # theme() customizes various plot elements, such as grid lines and axis text properties 
  # (color, size, and angle of x-axis labels).
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray', linewidth = 0.2),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray', linewidth = 0.1),
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = 'black', size = 9, angle = 30, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(color = 'black', size = 9)
  )

# display the plot
violin_boxplot_cytosol

# save the plot as an EPS file
# ggsave(
#   filename = "violin_boxplot_cytosol.eps",
#   device = 'eps',
#   height = 2, width = 2, units = 'in'
# )
```

### What have we learned
- How to reshape data from external sources (such as search engines or online tools) into a format suitable for statistical analysis and figure generation.
- How to use `ggplot2` to create a violin boxplot, fine-tune the plot with specific functions, and save the final figure in EPS format for publication or further use.
